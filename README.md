I'm not a Gif maker, I'm a developer  
==================

Recently, I discovered the cool animation which transforms a tick into a plus in the I/O 2014 app.
I looked for code that animates this button and I came across this: a frame by frame animation aka GIF!

I through it must be a way to do it pragmatically. After reflection, it's not easy to get the same effect. 

Finally, I found a simple way (playing with canvas rotation + line translations) to mimic the animation.
